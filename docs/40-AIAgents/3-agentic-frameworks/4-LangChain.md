# LangChain

LangChain is an open-source framework developed by Harrison Chase. It is designed to simplify the development of applications that utilize large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a modular and flexible architecture that allows developers to easily integrate LLMs with various data sources, APIs, and other tools.  

We have already explore how to create a LangChain agent in the RAG Chatbot lab, now lets see if we can get a simple agent up and running.

## Create LangChain Agent

- navigate to `labs/40-AIAgents` folder, open `game_agent_v3_langchain.py` file.

```python
cd labs/40-AIAgents
```

- run the agent and see the console output.

```python
python game_agent_v3_langchain.py
```
// add screenshot of console output
