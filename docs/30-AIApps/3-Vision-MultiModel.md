## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Integrate GPT-4o vision capabilities for image analysis
2. Handle image uploads and base64 encoding
3. Create multi-modal prompts combining text and images
4. Build practical vision-based business solutions

## Scenario

Your customer service team needs to process product images efficiently. The goal is to deliver a seamless and efficient customer service experience that enhances operational accuracy and accelerates processing times through automated image analysis.

## Goal

Leverage GPT-4o's vision capabilities for accurate analysis and verification of product photos. This reduces processing time while ensuring consistency and reliability in decision-making, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Understanding GPT-4o Vision

GPT-4o with vision can:
- Analyze and describe images in detail
- Answer questions about visual content
- Identify objects, people, text in images
- Perform comparative analysis between images
- Extract structured data from visual information

### Step 2: Examine the Vision Component

Navigate to `apps-chat\chatbot-frontend\pages\vision\Vision.tsx`. You'll find:
- An image upload input for local files
- A text input for questions about the image
- A describe button to trigger analysis
- Display areas for the uploaded image and AI response

### Step 3: Implement Image Processing

Before sending to the vision API, you need to:
- Handle file uploads
- Convert images to base64 format
- Validate image types and sizes
- Prepare multi-modal messages

#### Key Functions to Implement:

```typescript
function getBase64(event) {
    // TODO: Convert uploaded file to base64
    // 1. Get the selected file from the event
    // 2. Create a FileReader instance
    // 3. Read the file as data URL (base64)
    // 4. Handle success and error cases
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the Vision API

Your task is to complete the `visionApi` function to:
- Construct multi-modal messages with text and image
- Send requests to GPT-4o vision endpoint
- Handle the API response
- Extract and return the analysis results

#### Message Structure:
```typescript
const messages = [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." },
    {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": userQuestion
            },
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "imageUrl": {
                    "url": base64ImageData
                }
            }
        ]
    }
];
```

### Step 5: Advanced Vision Applications

#### Product Quality Inspection
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are a quality control inspector. 
Analyze the product image for:
- Manufacturing defects
- Damage or wear
- Compliance with specifications
- Overall condition assessment`;
```

#### Document Analysis
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `Extract and structure information from this document:
- Key data points
- Tables and forms
- Signatures and stamps
- Text content`;
```

#### Inventory Management
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `Analyze this inventory image:
- Count visible items
- Identify product types
- Assess organization and storage
- Note any issues or discrepancies`;
```


### Real-World Applications
