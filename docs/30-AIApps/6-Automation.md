:::info TUTORIAL OVERVIEW
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement intelligent automation using LLM function calling to streamline store operations.

**What you'll build:** An automation system that can control various store functions through natural language commands.

**What you'll learn:**
- LLM function calling mechanisms
- Workflow automation design
- Integration with business systems
- Conversational automation interfaces
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Implement LLM function calling for automation
2. Design automation workflows for business processes
3. Create conversational interfaces for system control
4. Integrate automation with existing business systems

## Scenario

Your store operations involve many repetitive manual tasks that could be automated to improve efficiency and reduce errors. The goal is to leverage LLM function-calling mechanisms to automate repetitive in-store tasks, improving accuracy, reducing labor-intensive efforts, and streamlining overall operations.

## Goal

Build an intelligent automation system that can understand natural language commands and execute appropriate business functions, similar to a smart assistant for store operations.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Understanding Function Calling

Function calling allows LLMs to:
- Understand user intent from natural language
- Map requests to specific functions
- Execute functions with appropriate parameters
- Provide feedback about actions taken
- Chain multiple functions for complex workflows

### Step 2: Design Your Automation Functions

Start by identifying common store operations that can be automated:

    The basic solution is provided below. Feel free to expand on it to make it more interesting!
    Go to `labs/30-AIApps` in terminal, run `npm install`, then run `node 6-Automation.js` to see it in action.
